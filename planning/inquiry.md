# Inquiry

## User/Stakeholkder/Audience:
* Ms Walker

## Issue:
* User has bad data organisation

## Inquiry Focus:
* How can a digital technologies outcome help in solving user data organisation issues?

## Survey Questions:
* Do you ever have trouble organising data?
* What is the exact issue you have with organising data?
* Is this an issue that could be solved by a desktop/mobile application?
* Why are you having this issue?
* How could this issue be solved?

## Developing Refined Question:
* From my research I have conducted, and the suverys I have sent out, I have concluded that I will be making a desktop application outcome.
* This is because I believe it best suits the needs of my users, primary stakeholders (miss walker), and secondary sakeholders (other users).
* I have come to this conclusion due to the methods shown in the research best applying to a desktop application outcome.
* After asking my primary stakeholder (Miss Walker), I have also come to the conclusion that a desktop application outcome will suit her best, as her issue with data orgamisation is specifficaly on her windows computer.
* The surveys I have conducted have also suggested that a desktop application outcome will best the best, wtih most respondants suggesting that as a solution when I asked.
* And therefore will refine the paramaters of my inquriy question from a "digital technologies outcome" to a "desktop application outcome".

## Refined Question:
* How could a desktop application outcome help in sorting user data?
