# Proposed Outcome - Desktop Application:

## Background:
After looking around for issues, I had found a teacher, with an issue that i believe could be solved by a digital technologies outcome, this issue is data organisation on said teachers computer.

Initial research, in the form of articles and surveys of students and teachers, showed me that many others also have issues organisation their data, with [57.1%](..\research\data_org_graph.png) of respondents to my survey saying they also have an issue. Respondents also believed that their issues could be solved with a digital technologies outcome such as a desktop application.

As a result, I developed the following refined inquiry question:
* How could a desktop application outcome help in sorting user data?

## Research and Findings
I began by researching articles on data organisation for businesses and data organisation methods. I found many good methods for organising data of which I can incorporate into my outcome. For instance "Johnny decimal".

I also surveyed students and teachers from the school, from this I was able to gather that the majority of respondents to my survey, [57.1%](..\research\data_org_graph.png), had an issue with data organisation, I also asked the primary stakeholder (Miss Walker) and secondary stakeholders (users, teachers) how I would be able to solve their issue, one promising suggestion was a desktop application that is able to sort their files and or let them search through them.

## Ethical Implications:
I must make sure that my outcome does not act in any unethical way, e.g. does not act maliciously.

## Privacy Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome respects user privacy, this especially important with my outcome as it will be handling sensitive user data and helping to sort it.

## Security Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome is very secure, this is because the outcome will be working with user data, and any vulnerability could lead to exposing said data in unintended ways.

## Data Integrity Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome is tested robustly, as this outcome will be working with and sorting the users data, if the outcome fails, it could potentially delete/corrupt valuable data.

## Potential Risks:
* Scope creep - I must make sure that the outcome I propose is do able for me, otherwise it will be a waste of time and effort
* Time - I must make sure to stick to a strict time management schedule in order to make sure that I am able to deliver the outcome to users in time.

## Proposed Solution:
Based on the surveys and research I have completed, and feedback from the primary and secondary stakeholders, I propose a desktop application outcome, that could be used in order to help target end users in sorting and searching through selected data.

The reason why I have chosen to use a website (over other possible outcomes e.g. social media) is that I feel that a website will best the clearest way to present the information (located in appendix) to my audience of students and a website will also offer me the flexibility to present the info in the way I want it, it will allow me to add quizzes to my website to reinforce the information.

## Research Impacts:

One impact the research has had on this inquiry is that, from my survey data, I have been shown many people do not know about the goal and this has showed me that outcome is necessary.

Another impact this research has had on my outcome is that the research has shown me many ways to hold elected officials to account and given me the information necessary to make the outcome.

## Requirements / Specifications:
The website will have information, statistics, and a guide as to what people can do to themselves.
There will be questions related to how we can hold elected officials to account in order to quiz the users and there will also be an information section, containing statistics and a guide.
There will be a minimum of three pages.

## Resources:
The following resources will be needed to complete the website.
•	Relevant images
•	Text editor (VSCode)
•	Web browsers for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
•	Relevant information
•	Computers, including phones and desktop computers
•	Relevant statistics
•	Stakeholder feedback

## Conclusion:
From all of this research, I can conclude that the most useful outcome for my target audience that will be able to answer all of my inquiry questions is a website.  The reason I have come to this conclusion is that a website will be able to easily display information, data, and images that will be able to answer my inquiry questions.
