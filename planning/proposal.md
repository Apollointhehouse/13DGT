# Proposed Outcome - Desktop Application:

## Background:
After looking around for issues, I had found a teacher, with an issue that I believe could be solved by a digital technologies outcome, this issue is data organisation on said teachers computer.

Initial research, in the form of articles and surveys of students and teachers, showed me that many others also have issues organisation their data, with [57.1%](..\research\data_org_graph.png) of respondents to my survey saying they also have an issue. Respondents also believed that their issues could be solved with a digital technologies outcome such as a desktop application.

As a result, I developed the following refined inquiry question:
* How could a desktop application outcome help in sorting user data?

## Research and Findings
I began by researching articles on data organisation for businesses and data organisation methods. I found many good methods for organising data of which I can incorporate into my outcome. For instance "Johnny decimal".

I also surveyed students and teachers from the school, from this I was able to gather that the majority of respondents to my survey, [57.1%](data_org_graph.png), had an issue with data organisation, I also asked the primary stakeholder (Miss Walker) and secondary stakeholders (users, teachers) how I would be able to solve their issue, one promising suggestion was a desktop application that is able to sort their files and or let them search through them.

## Ethical Implications:
I must make sure that my outcome does not act in any unethical way, e.g. does not act maliciously.

## Privacy Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome respects user privacy, this especially important with my outcome as it will be handling sensitive user data and helping to sort it.

## Security Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome is very secure, this is because the outcome will be working with user data, and any vulnerability could lead to exposing said data in unintended ways.

## Data Integrity Implications:
I must make sure that the outcome is tested robustly, as this outcome will be working with and sorting the users data, if the outcome fails, it could potentially delete/corrupt valuable data.

## Potential Risks:
* Scope creep - I must make sure that the outcome I propose is do able for me, otherwise it will be a waste of time and effort
* Time - I must make sure to stick to a strict time management schedule in order to make sure that I am able to deliver the outcome to users in time.

## Proposed Solution:
Based on the surveys and research I have completed, and feedback from the primary and secondary stakeholders, I propose a desktop application outcome, that could be used in order to help target end users in sorting and searching through selected data.

The reason why I have chosen a desktop application outcome is that, looking through my survey responses, most respondents agree that their issue could be solved by a desktop application outcome, and most of the ways they suggest fixing it best correlated with desktop application outcomes, I also believe that this issue effects desktop users the most and so having a desktop application outcome targeted at them will allow me to provide the best solution.

## Research Impacts:
One impact the research has had on this proposal, is that, I have, through my survey responses, found that the most suitable outcome for my users would be a desktop application outcome, without this critical end user feedback, I may have selected a different outcome leaving the users worse off.

Another impact that the research I have conducted has had on my outcome is that I now know many methods of organising data, which I can use in my desktop application outcome to help effectively fix the users issue.

## Requirements / Specifications:
* The desktop application outcome must have an easy to navigate UI (User Interface) and must implement UI design heuristics.
* The desktop application outcome must solve the users issue in a fast and cost effective manner.
* The desktop application outcome must have appropriate error control systems, allowing the end-user to know when a process has gone wrong and take appropriate actions.
* The desktop application outcome must be fast and responsive.
* The desktop application outcome must be made in consultation with potential end-users (primary and secondary stakeholders).
* The desktop application outcome must be secure and protect user data at all costs.


## Resources:
The following resources will be needed to complete the desktop application outcome.
* End-user feedback/consultation (primary and secondary stakeholders e.g. Miss Walker, other teachers, and students).
* Text editor (VSCode, notepad).
* VCS (Version Control System), I will be using GIT.
* Desktop computers in order to test the desktop application outcome.
* Research on data organisation methods in order to be implemented into said outcome.
* End-user survey responses in order to help tune the outcome to the users needs.
* Suitable programming languages

## Conclusion:
From all of my research and surveys, I am able to conclude that the most effective outcome for my target audience will be a desktop application outcome.

The reason I have come to this conclusion is that my surveys of my potential end-users have all suggested that a desktop application outcome would be the best outcome to solve their issues, also the research I have conducted has given me many methods of data organisation which I believe are best suited for a desktop application outcome.
